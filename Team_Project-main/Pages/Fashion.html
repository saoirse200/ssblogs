      <h2>Summer Trend Alert</h2>
      <h5>Written by S.Flynn, April 23, 2021</h5>
      <div class="img" ><img src="../images/fashion.jpg" alt="makeup"/></div>
      <p>While it’s been a quiet year for the fashion world so far in 2021, this season has unveiled seriously bold and stylish designs. 
	  Large and in-charge blazers, bold blue bags, and sleek face masks dominated Fashion Week in Paris, London and New York over the last few weeks. 
	  This year, some of the most influential decades have played a huge role in this season’s looks. We’re loving every single one of them, and you can see why. 
	  From Paris to Milan, find serious style inspiration with the top fashion trends spotted at SS21 Fashion Weeks.</p>
	  
	  <h5> 1. Oversized Shoulderpad Boyfriend Jackets</h5>
	  <p>Create a long line silhouette and play with shapes with an 80s-inspired oversized boyfriend blazer.
	  With the help of shoulder pads, this outerwear cinches in your waist and elongates your legs. 
	  Rock this look with a pair of straight-leg trousers or leather shorts for an ultra-modern style.</p>
	  
	  <h5> 2. Black Face Masks</h5>
	  <p>When it comes to protecting yourself, you may as well do it beautifully. 
	  These sleek black face masks match almost any outfit you wear, and they offer great coverage for your nose and mouth. 
	  Opt for a silky fabric for easier breathing or choose something with embellishments if you’re feeling fancy. 
	  The beauty behind this face-covering is the limitless styling opportunities that come along with it.</p>
	  
	  <h5> 3. Head Scarfs</h5>
	  <p>Taking inspiration from the 50s and the 60s, this sleek fashion trend is coming back in a big way. 
	  Headscarves protect your hair and add a finishing touch to your outfit without overdoing it. 
	  Choose from a silky design with floral motifs or intricate patterns, or keep it simple with bold colors and block letters. 
	  When styling this accessory, you can wrap the fabric under your chin in a loose knot, or have it hanging off the back of your head – mix things up by wrapping it around your neck or let it dangle from your bag. </p>
	  
	  <h5> 4. Pastel Tones</h5>
	  <p>Another trend that has continued to dominate this year has been pastel tones. 
	  These sorbet-inspired colors are the perfect option for summer and they suit a wide variety of skin tones. 
	  Choose from a boiler suit in cool mint green or an oversized trench coat in soft lavender – better yet, try them both simultaneously.</p>
	  
	  <h5> 5. Yellow Bags</h5>
	  <p>This season yellow bags have taken over the runways and the streets. 
	  This trend is easy to replicate and it is timeless – choose a small clutch to spice up an outfit or find a mustard tote for your daily needs. 
	  There are so many shades to choose from that suit your taste, and they look incredible when paired with other vibrant hues or a monochromatic ensemble.</p>
	  
	  <h5> 6. Yellow and Camel Tones</h5>
	  <p>Keep it neutral with yellow and camel color styling – the trend taken from the 70s has gotten a serious facelift. 
	  Mixing and matching these shades adds dimension and depth to your ensembles, no matter the clothes you prefer to wear. 
	  Try a light brown suit or coat with a mustard turtleneck for the cooler months or a sleek tan T-shirt and camel pair of flare pants.</p>
