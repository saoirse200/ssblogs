      <h2>How Long Should you Keep your Make-up?</h2>

      <p>If you take a gander into a lady’s makeup bag, you will definitely discover a cringeworthy hoard of years-old makeup.
	    Whether someone bought something because they were too easily swayed by a salesperson at a makeup desk or went on a shopping spree, chances are they have several foundation bottles or primer potions that have only been pumped once or there are makeup pallets that only one or two shades have been used in it. 
		So, the question is can makeup expire and how long should we be keeping our makeup? Although it is actually not mandatory for cosmetic companies to put expiration dates on products there can be multiple signs that you should toss some of your makeup products immediately.
		The main sign that your make up has expired is if your skin has become irritated or has broken out from using products. If you’re noticing that your skin has been breaking out abnormally, chances are it could be from old makeup so toss it now! 
		According to dermatologists, there are some expiration dates that people should follow with makeup:</p>
			<p>&nbsp;1. Liquid products i.e., Foundation, generally last 12 months.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;2. Mascaras and eyeliners should be tossed after 3 months.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;3. Lip products generally last two years.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>&nbsp;4. Compacts i.e., Eyeshadow or Blush, generally last two years or more.&nbsp;</p>
		</ol>
		<p> So ladies, start cleaning out your makeup bags now, those old products are a breeding ground for germs and other nasty little things!</p>
