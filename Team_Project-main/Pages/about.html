  <h2>About Us </h2>
  <p>Welcome to S&S Blogs, your number one blog for lots of different topics and pieces. Our Mission is to become the number one blogs website in Ireland and we're dedicated to giving you the very best blogs and articles, with a focus on creativity, customer service and uniqueness.
	Founded in 2021 by Siobhan Flynn and Saoirse Covaci, S&S Blogs has come a long way from a dream of two college students. When S&S Blogs was first created, our passion for creativity and writing drove us to do intense research about websites for writing, 
	and gave us the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online blog. We now serve customers all over Ireland, and are thrilled to be a part of the blog wing of the internet.

	We hope you enjoy our service as much as we enjoy offering it to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p>Siobhan Flynn, Co. Founder & Director</p>
	<p>Saoirse Covaci, Co. Founder & Designer</p>

  <h2>What We Stand For </h2>
  <p>The No. 1 thing we value here at S&S Blogs is that our customers come first. Without our customers, our idea and passion would be just another website, forgotten about on the internet.
	Although our customers do come first, we will not tolerate any offensive, racist or hate posts on S&S Blogs. If we see an offensive post of any kind it will be taken down immediately and the users account will be deleted.
	We have seen all of the recent racial issues come to light, like the BLM Movement and the fight against Asian Hate Crimes, and we will not tolarate posts of any kind that spread hate against other races. 
	Here at S&S BLogs, we stand with all of you against racial crimes of any kind and we will do our best to make sure no hate is spread on our website.
	We want S&S Blogs to be a place of positivity so please do not make any negative posts on our website.</p>
	<p> Thank you.</p>

        <p>"Writing has always been one of the things that I’m passionate about. 
		I found that, for myself, writing is very therapeutic and keeps my brain working which helps greatly especially in these times of COVID and lockdown. 
		Because writing helped us so much in these dark times, we wanted to create a place where others can keep their heads occupied and get some inspiration, and so S&S Blogs was created. 
		I hope you love our website as much as we do!"</p>

        <p>"I have always had a great love for reading and writing they were even my strongest subjects in school! 
		I am fortunate enough to have the ability to have an open-mindset, which helps ideas come to mind extremely fast. 
		Through this, writing has become my passion.
		With S&S Blogs, I want to help others find their creative path in life and help them to generate new ideas through reading and writing.		
		We hope S&S Blogs inspires all readers and writers out there. Get creative with us now!"</p>
