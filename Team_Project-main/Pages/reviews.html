      <h2>Is the Dyson Airwrap Worth It?</h2>
      <h5>Post Written by S.Flynn, April 28, 2021</h5>

	  <h5>What is the Dyson Airwrap?</h5>
      <p>The Airwrap is a hair-styling tool by Dyson that can dry and style your hair simultaneously. 
	  It features various attachments to achieve different looks, 
	  including a blow-drying nozzle that helps to pre-dry hair for curling, rounded and flat brushes that allow you to dry your hair while brushing through it, 
	  and curling iron barrels to help you achieve bouncy curls.</p>
	  
	  <p>The Airwrap uses a special technology similar to jet engines that creates a vortex to pull the hair towards the barrels or attachments,
	  keeping strands firmly against their surfaces while also monitoring and adjusting the heat so your hair never burns.</p>
	  
	  <p>The Dyson Airwrap has been a viral phenomenon within the past year alone, but it's actually been in high demand since its launch in 2018. 
	  It continues to sell out, adding customers to a six-month waitlist despite its steep €499 price tag. 
	  So, the question we want to know today is, is this styler worth the cost?</p>
	  
	  <h5>Is It Worth it?</h5>
	  <p>In short, yes. After testing it for three months, 
	  I can confidently say that if my Airwrap caught on fire tomorrow, without hesitation, I'd pull out my credit card and spend the €499 to purchase another one.</p>
	  
	  <p>The fact that I can dry my entire head of hair in less than 15 minutes, 
	  and that I'm left with a professional-looking style that truly looks and feels healthier, is enough to justify the investment on my end. 
	  My hair never feels hot to the touch, even when using the higher heat/speed setting, thanks to some high-tech features like built-in temperature control.
	  I have been able to discard the rest of my hot hair tools as I no longer need them with this one step styler</p>
	  
	  <h5>Some Things to Note About the Airwrap.</h5>
	  <p>The Airwrap can be tricky and takes time to get used to, so don't disregard this tool right away.
	  Give it some time and practise and use the styler on your head often to find the most comfortable grip and position.</p>
	  
	  <h5>Final Thoughts.</h5>
	  <p>The fact that it not only works well but takes the place of three other hair appliances is another reason I'd recommend it. 
	  Plus, it comes with a two-year parts-and-labor warranty. 
	  You'll need to fill out some forms to activate it, but it's worth the effort for the peace of mind.
	  All things considered, the Airwrap is definitely worth it for anyone who does their hair frequently.</p>
	  
	  <h5>Alternatives</h5>
	  <p> If you're looking for a less expensive option, the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer (€59 in Argos) comes with a round, nondetachable nylon and tufted bristle brush and uses ionic technology to eliminate static and frizz and promote faster drying. 
	  You won't have the benefit of multiple attachments or curling barrels, but if all you're after is a simple way to dry and style your hair with at least a bit of shape, this is a good alternative. </p>
