      <h2>What is the Super League?</h2>

	  <h5>So What is the Super League?</h5>
      <p>The Super League is a new breakaway league featuring 20 of the biggest clubs in Europe, including 12 established "founding clubs" – 
	  Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd, Tottenham, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Juventus, Inter and Milan – set to rival the Champions League.
	  The 15 founding clubs will be competing in the tournament on a permanent basis, unable to be relegated</p>
	  
	  <p>It is understood that clubs playing in the Super League will still feature in their domestic leagues, but with the competition for the top four all but removed, 
	  and with their Super League presence never in danger, the tournament could threaten to imbalance football forever.</p>
	  
	  <h5>Why Are Fans Protesting the Super League?</h5>
	  <p>The overwhelming issues are that the competition is elitist and exclusionary, removing healthy competition, 
	  and that the owners of the clubs involved seem to be more fuelled by financial reasons than by a genuine love of the game.</p>
	  
	  <p> Fans of the "Big Six" Premier League teams were left upset and disappointed by the Super League announcement, having not been informed of the plans. Coaches and players were also not aware of the situation.
		In the hours following the confirmation of the Super League, fans of the Premier League "Big Six" took to their stadiums to protest the announcement, with Liverpool fans hanging banners and flags outside of Anfield.</p>
		
		<p>But should the Super League be introduced, this breeding of healthy competition could be removed entirely 
		and rendered meaningless should the biggest teams in Europe compete in a tournament where there are no consequences for losing.</p>
