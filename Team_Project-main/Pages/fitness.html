      <h2>The Best Fitness Trackers/Watches</h2>
      <h5>Submitted by A. Byrne, April 28, 2021</h5>
      <div class="img" ><img src="../images/fitness.jpg" alt="Fitness"/></div>
      <p>Fitness trackers are an incredibly personal item so when picking one there are a lot of factors to consider. 
	  Not only do they have to be comfortable and attractive, but they must also accommodate your lifestyle and when and how you like to work out.
	  Here are our top picks of the best fitness trackers on the market today!</p>
	  
	  <h5>Best All Round Option:</h5>
	  <h6> FITBIT CHARGE 4 </h6>
	  <p>Fitbit's trackers remain affordable, attractive, and comfortable, with an easy-to-use app and a huge, devoted community. The Charge 4 is its best yet, with features like built-in GPS that I've seen only in much more expensive trackers.
		The Charge 4 also has some smart upgrades, like a Zone Minutes metric that encourages newbies to explore high-intensity exercise and an "outdoor workout" category for rambling hikes and golf games. Fitbit also has the best sleep-tracking hardware and software</p>
	  <p> It is currently priced at €129 from PC World</p>
	  <hr/>
	  
	  <h5> Best Budget Friendly Option</h5>
	  <h6> LETSFIT FITNESS TRACKER </h6>
	  <p>Letsfit's smartwatch is a knockoff of the Fitbit Versa, right down to the font on the watch face, but the differences are obvious to anyone who has used (and loved) a real Versa. 
	  The latch is made from cheap plastic; the tracked metrics on the watch face are rudimentary; the VeryFitPro app is unattractive and not a joy to consult.
		But it's waterproof, and the pedometer is reasonably accurate. The battery life is about one week, and the band is soft and comfortable. </p>
	  <p> For the reasonable price of £21 from Amazon, I think an unatractive app is a compromise we can settle on.  </p>
	  <hr/>
	  
	  <h5>Best Fitness Tracker for iPhone Users.</h5>
	  <h6> APPLE WATCH (ANY SERIES)</h6>
	  <p>The Apple watch has all of the bells and whistles, including fast charging time, blood-oxygen monitoring, ECG monitoring and integration with Fitness+,
	  Apple's new on-demand streaming service that will integrate your workouts between the watch, your phone screen, and your Apple TV. 
	  The Apple Watches are definitely the most attractive looking fitness trackers out there and they are also the most high-tech which explains the fairly steep price tag some series have.
	  But as an Apple watch user myself, it is definitly worth it.</p>
	  <p> Apple Watch Series 3 priced from €199.</p>
	  <p> Apple Watch Series 6 priced from €429.</p>
	  <p> Apple Watch SE priced from €299.</p>
	  <hr/>
	  
	  <h5>Best Running Tracker Option</h5>
	  <h6> GARMIN FORERUNNER 745 </h6>
	  <p>If you're a runner or triathlete, we recommend Garmin's Forerunner series. The latest is the Forerunner 745, which, like all of Garmin's watches, is one of the most accurate GPS trackers we've seen. It's incredibly light and small, waterproof to record your swims, 
	  and has all sorts of performance-analysis tools to help you optimize your workouts for peak performance on race day, like offering suggestions for recovery and predicting your race times.</p>
	  <p>The 745 is just the latest one on the market, but there are more-affordable versions. If you're not quite at a place where a €450 watch is a sensible investment, 
	  we recommend Garmin's entry-level models like the Forerunner 35.</p>
	  <p>Garmin Forerunner 745 - €450.</p>
	  <p>Garmin Forerunner 35 - €99.</p>
